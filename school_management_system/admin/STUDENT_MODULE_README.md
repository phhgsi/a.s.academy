## Usage Instructions

1. **Add New Student:** Visit `/admin/students_add.php`
2. **View All Students:** Visit `/admin/students.php` 
3. **Edit Student:** Click edit button in students list or visit `/admin/students_add.php?id=X`

## Next Steps

The following optional enhancements could be added in future:

- Advanced search and filtering
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Pagination for large datasets
- CSRF token protection
- Student profile view page

## Migration Notes

The old files had complex photo capture functionality that was causing issues. The new implementation focuses on core functionality with a clean, maintainable codebase that matches the working `students_add_simple.php` logic but with modern UI integration.

All navigation links have been updated to point to the correct files (`students.php` instead of `students_list.php`).
